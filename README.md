## Hosting (Outdated as we are currently preparing to launch beta version)
We are currently hosting the application at ~~http://nusexchange.herokuapp.com/~~

Note: Make sure to use the http:// and not the https:// version. The https:// version
will load the front end but the backend functionality will not work. 

This is only a temporary site and we will take the application down soon to continue
work on it.

## Getting Started	

#### 1. Fork and git clone this repo

#### 2. npm install dependencies for both `backend` and `client` folders

#### 3. There are a couple of paths that have to be changed:

1. `backend/routes/getResults.js` : Change `pythonPath` and `PythonShell.run()` 
2. `backend/routes/getPdf.js` : Change `pythonPath` and `PythonShell.run()`
3. `backend/routes/getPdf.py` : Change `PdfFileReader()` and `dest` path
4. `backend/routes/getNlp.js` : Change `pythonPath` and `PythonShell.run()`
